## Usage

To use these programs, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/krishng03/4th-SEM-RVCE-DAA-CODES.git
   ```

2. **Compile the Programs:**

    Use an appropriate C compiler (e.g., GCC) to compile the programs. For example:
    ```bash
    gcc 1merge_sort.c -o merge_sort
    ```
    Replace 1merge_sort.c with the name of the program you want to compile.

3. **Run the Programs:**

   Execute the compiled program:
   ```bash
   ./merge_sort
   ```
   Follow the program\'s prompts or input requirements.
